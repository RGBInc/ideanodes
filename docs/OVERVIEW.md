# IdeaNodes Overview & Philosophy

## Introduction
**IdeaNodes** is a "Sequential Thinking Engine" designed to augment human creativity through structured, AI-assisted ideation. Unlike traditional chat interfaces or static note-taking apps, IdeaNodes treats thoughts as connected **Nodes** in a linear or branching graph, forcing a rhythm of expansion and refinement.

It serves as a co-pilot for lateral thinking, allowing users to break out of creative ruts by "Remixing" their thought process into entirely new domains.

## The Philosophy
### 1. Sequential Thinking
Deep thought requires structure. By forcing ideas into discrete "Nodes," we prevent the cognitive overload of a blank page. Each node represents a single state of thought—a problem, a solution, or a critique.

### 2. Lateral "Remixing"
True innovation often comes from cross-pollination. The core "Remix" feature takes an existing logical structure (a blueprint) and applies it to a completely unrelated field (e.g., taking the architecture of a "Coffee Shop" and applying it to "Cloud Computing"). This preserves the *structure* of the solution while changing the *context*.

### 3. Durable & Agentic
We believe AI should be more than a chatbot; it should be a durable process. When you ask for a generation or remix, it is treated as a workflow that persists, retries, and completes, even if you close the tab.

## User Flow & Anticipated Experience

### The "Session" Lifecycle
1.  **Inception**: The user starts with a single "Seed Node" (e.g., "I want to build a better mousetrap").
2.  **Expansion**:
    *   **Manual**: The user adds their own thoughts.
    *   **Generate**: The user clicks "Generate," and the AI analyzes the context to propose the logical next step (Solution -> Implementation -> Critique).
3.  **Refinement**:
    *   Users can edit any node.
    *   Voice input is treated as a first-class citizen for rapid brain-dumping.
4.  **Lateral Shift (The "Aha!" Moment)**:
    *   The user selects "Remix."
    *   They choose a new target topic (e.g., "Space Travel").
    *   The system extracts the *abstract logic* of the current session and re-instantiates it in the new domain, creating a brand new Session.
5.  **Export/Action**: The session is exported to Markdown/JSON for use in other tools.

### User Interface Principles
*   **Fluidity**: Interfaces should disappear. Icons hide until needed.
*   **Tactile Feedback**: Sounds (Click, Delete, Success) reinforce the "mechanical" feel of building a thought structure.
*   **Focus**: The UI is minimalist, prioritizing the content of the nodes.
