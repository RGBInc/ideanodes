# The 100-Year Plan

IdeaNodes is not just an app; it is a long-term project to map and augment human thought.

## Phase 1: The Tool (Years 1-2)
**Goal**: Build the best "Single Player" thinking tool.
*   [x] Basic Node Graph
*   [x] AI Autocomplete
*   [x] Lateral Remixing
*   [ ] **Mobile Native App**: Wrapper for iOS/Android with share intent.
*   [ ] **Multi-modal**: Images, Audio clips, File attachments in nodes.
*   [ ] **Local-First**: Sync engine that works perfectly offline (PouchDB/RxDB integration with Convex).

## Phase 2: The Network (Years 3-10)
**Goal**: Connect thinkers.
*   **Multiplayer**: Real-time collaboration on the same graph (Google Docs style).
*   **The "Global Graph"**: Ability to publish nodes to a public commons.
*   **Semantic Linking**: AI automatically links your private thought to a public node that solves your problem.
*   **Agent Ecosystem**: Marketplace for specialized "Thinker Agents" (e.g., "The Legal Critic", "The Physics Simulator").

## Phase 3: The Exocortex (Years 10-30)
**Goal**: Direct Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) integration.
*   **Thought-to-Node**: Neural interfaces (like Neuralink) mapping abstract thought directly to graph structures without typing.
*   **Augmented Reality**: Overlaying node graphs on the physical world.
*   **AI Symbiosis**: The AI is no longer a tool you "call"; it is a constant background process suggesting paths in real-time.

## Phase 4: The Global Brain (Years 30-100)
**Goal**: Collective Intelligence.
*   **Humanity-Scale Problem Solving**: Merging millions of user graphs to solve climate change, interstellar travel, etc.
*   **The Noosphere**: A digital layer of thought that exists independently of individual users, constantly evolving and refining itself.
*   **Post-Biological Preservation**: Uploading "Thinking Styles" so that great thinkers can continue to contribute after death.
